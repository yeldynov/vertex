# Next.js Logs installation

1.  1

    ## Install OpenTelemetry packages

    Required

    Terminal

    ```bash
    npm install @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/resources
    ```

2.  2

    ## Get your project token

    Required

    You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate log requests. This is the same key you use for capturing events and exceptions with the PostHog SDK.

    > **Important:** Use your **project token** which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

    You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project).

    ## Enable instrumentation in Next.js

    Required

    > **Note:** This step is only needed on Next.js 13.2–14.x. For Next.js 15 and later, `instrumentation.ts` is enabled by default and the `experimental.instrumentationHook` option is deprecated — remove it from your config if it's set.

    On Next.js 14 and earlier, add the following to your `next.config.js` (or `next.config.mjs`) to enable the instrumentation hook:

    JavaScript

    ```javascript
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        instrumentationHook: true,
      },
    }
    
    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```

4.  4

    ## Create the instrumentation file

    Required

    Create an `instrumentation.ts` (or `instrumentation.js`) file in the root of your project (or inside `src/` if you use that folder).

    typescript

    ```typescript
    import { BatchLogRecordProcessor, LoggerProvider } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-logs'
    import { OTLPLogExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http'
    import { logs } from '@opentelemetry/api-logs'
    import { resourceFromAttributes } from '@opentelemetry/resources'
    
    // Create LoggerProvider outside register() so it can be exported and flushed in route handlers
    export const loggerProvider = new LoggerProvider({
      resource: resourceFromAttributes({ 'service.name': 'my-nextjs-app' }),
      processors: [
        new BatchLogRecordProcessor({
          exporter: new OTLPLogExporter({
            url: 'https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs',
            headers: {
              Authorization: 'Bearer <ph_project_token>',
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
          }),
        }),
      ],
    })
    
    export function register() {
      if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
        logs.setGlobalLoggerProvider(loggerProvider)
      }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** The `loggerProvider` is created outside of `register()` so it can be exported and used to flush logs in route handlers. This pattern is necessary because Route Handlers complete execution before batched logs have a chance to be sent to the collector. By exporting the provider, we can manually flush logs at the end of each request.

    > **Important:** The `Content-Type: application/json` header is required.

    Alternatively, you can pass the API key as a query parameter:

    typescript

    ```typescript
    new OTLPLogExporter({
      url: 'https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs?token=<ph_project_token>',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    })
    ```

    ## Use OpenTelemetry logging

    Required

    Now you can use OpenTelemetry logging in your server-side code (API routes, Server Components, etc.):

    typescript

    ```typescript
    import { SeverityNumber } from '@opentelemetry/api-logs'
    import { after } from 'next/server'
    import { loggerProvider } from '@/instrumentation'
    
    const logger = loggerProvider.getLogger('my-nextjs-app')
    
    export async function GET() {
      logger.emit({
        body: 'API request received',
        severityNumber: SeverityNumber.INFO,
        attributes: {
          endpoint: '/api/example',
          method: 'GET',
        },
      })
    
      // Ensure logs are flushed before the serverless function freezes
      after(async () => {
        await loggerProvider.forceFlush()
      })
    
      return Response.json({ success: true })
    }
    ```

    > **Important:** Without calling `forceFlush()`, your logs may not be sent. Route Handlers complete execution before the OpenTelemetry batch processor has a chance to send logs to the collector. The `after()` function from `next/server` runs code after the response is sent, ensuring logs are flushed before the serverless function freezes.

    > **Note:** `after()` is stable in Next.js 15.1+ (available as `unstable_after` in 15.0). On Next.js 14 and earlier, it doesn't exist — flush before returning instead:
    >
    > typescript
    >
    > ```typescript
    > await loggerProvider.forceFlush()
    > return Response.json({ success: true })
    > ```

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

    1.  Send a test log from your application
    2.  Check the PostHog Logs interface for your log entries
    3.  Verify the logs appear in your project
